      <p>The responsible entity within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation and other national data protection laws is:

      <h2>Scope of data processing</h2>
      <p>We collect and use personal information of our users to the extent necessary to provide high-quality applications and to perform our services, including the display of product and price information related to scanned barcodes.

      In case where we make our services available free of charge, we finance our services through personalized advertising.</p>

      <h2>Legal basis</h2>
      <p>When processing personal data that is required to fulfill a contract with the user, point (b) of paragraph 1 of article 6 of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.

      If the processing is necessary to account for the legitimate interests of our company or a third party and if these interests are not overridden by interests of the user, the legal basis is provided by point (f) of paragraph 1 of article 6 of the GDPR.</p>

      <h2>Retention period</h2>
      <p>The personal data of the user will be deleted as soon as the underlying purpose for the collection has been fulfilled. The information on the retention period is given individually for each data processing operation.</p>

      <h1>Data processing operations</h1>
     
      <h2>Google Adsense</h2>
      <p>We use Google Adsense and show personalized ads within our barcode scanner apps to finance our development where apps are provided free of charge. Google Adsense stores user data including IP address and other personal data which can be used to identify the user's browser for the purpose of billing advertisers for ad clicks and detecting fraudulent clicks. The IP address will be anonymized after 9 months. For more information about Google Adsense and how to opt-out of personalized ads see <a>https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</p>

      <h2>Links to websites</h2>
      <p>When scanning product barcodes with the EAN or UPC format our barcode scanner apps may show links to external websites which can be used to obtain product and price information related to the scanned barcodes. When following these links, the barcode number and the user's IP address and browser/device information will be transmitted to and may be stored by the respective websites. In the case where these websites offer an interface (API) to retrieve product and price information, this data is also transmitted when users do not follow these links. This allows users to see relevant product and pricing information without leaving our apps. This automatic retrieval of product and price information can be turned off in the app settings. In addition, we participate in affiliate programs offered by some websites we link to. In these cases, the links will contain a marker tag indicating that the user is from our app. The websites offering the affiliates will pay us a commission, if the users purchases products on the linked website. Users do not pay a higher price when using affiliate links.</p>

      <h2>Email contact</h2>
      <p>Users may send us an email either directly or using forms within the apps. Personal data transmitted by email will be stored. In this context, data will not be disclosed with third parties. The data is used exclusively for processing the conversation. The data will be deleted, if the purpose of its collection has been fulfilled. This is the case when the conversion with the user has come to an end or it can be seen from the conversation that the subject has been clarified.</p>
